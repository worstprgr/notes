# Random Notes
http/socket loadtest with Python -> eventlet for multiple threads  

DevOps -> Create platforms, where devs can quickly and easy test their code  

Shadow traffic -> test a new feature silently and without harming the user ux  

canary test -> deploy a feature to e.g. 1% of the user base and monitor it
